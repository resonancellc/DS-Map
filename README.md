An editor for 4th Generation Pokémon games. WIP.

## Supported Games
Not all of the games are supported yet, although I'd like them to be.
* Pokémon Diamond (English)
* Pokémon Pearl (English)

## Features
Right now, features are very much in-progress and subject to change.
* Map loading/saving
  * NSBMD model import/export
  * Movements editing
  * Object editing
* Map header loading/saving
* Header-map linking (the program knows which maps go with which headers)
* Wild Pokémon loading/saving
* Script decompilation

Nothing is really ready for release, although they're getting there.
