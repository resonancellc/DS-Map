# DS Map
Copyright (c) 2015 Hopeless (Lost Heart)

A map editor for 4th Generation Pokémon games. WIP.

## Supported Games
Not all of the games are supported yet, although I'd like the to be.
* Pokémon Diamond (English)
* Pokémon Pearl (English)

## Features
Right now, it has a very limited set of features:
* Map loading/saving
  * NSBMD model import/export
* Map header loading/saving
* Header-map linking (the program knows which maps go with which headers)
* Wild Pokémon loading

As it stands, none of the features above are complete. But, they're getting there.
